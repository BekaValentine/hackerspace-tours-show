Hackerspace Tour Style
======================

This style of episode is a hosted episode that's more like a traditional travel TV show. Think Lonely Planet/Globe Trekker or Anthony Bourdain's shows.


Episode Template
----------------

The episode template is the structure of an episode. It's meant to be used to design a script that can be applied to the footage types to build up an episode automatically.

1. Teaser
  - "Today we're visiting Noisebridge, located at 2169 Mission St in the Mission District of San Francisco, CA! Started in 2007 as a circle of friends, it's one of the oldest hackerspaces in the US, and is open to the public every day during daytime hours! Let's go inside!"
  - Simple footage of the host outside the main entrance
  - Be sure to talk about who can use the space
2. Intro
  - Generic show intro / season specific style
  - Hackerspace specific map zoom intro
  - Mix of stock footage from the city the hackerspace is in

3. Getting to and into the space
  - Overall process
4. Main Segment
  The main segment is a mixture of two types of scenes
